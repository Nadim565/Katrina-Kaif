                    Personal life Kaif with her husband Vicky Kaushal in 2022 Kaif has a close relationship with her family, and the lack of a father figure in her life has given her a sense of responsibility towards them.[169] While Kaif's mother is Christian and her father
                    is Muslim, Kaif says she was allowed to practise a faith of her choice and is a "firm believer in God".[170][171] The Times of India reported in 2009 that she visits Siddhivinayak Temple, Mount Mary Church, and Sufi shrine Ajmer Sharif
                    Dargah before her films are released.[172] Kaif is reluctant to discuss her personal life, which has been the subject of media attention in India. "I have always believed that there is life before marriage and after marriage. Before
                    marriage...you are termed a single woman and I choose to conduct that part of my life with absolute dignity and discretion."[173] Although rumours of a relationship with actor Salman Khan emerged in 2003,[20] it was not until years
                    after their break-up that Kaif spoke of it, calling it her first serious relationship.[174] They have remained friends, and she credits Khan for giving her confidence and guidance.[175] Kaif was linked to actor Ranbir Kapoor during
                    the filming of Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani.[176] In August 2013, photographs of Kapoor and Kaif on holidays were leaked by Stardust which were interpreted as confirmation of a romantic relationship.[177] After the appearance of the
                    photos, Kaif published an open letter stating that she was "upset, distressed and invaded" by the breach of privacy.[178] They broke up in 2016.[179] Kaif married actor Vicky Kaushal on 9 December 2021 at Six Senses Resort, Fort Barwara

                    <h2><b> Mainstream success : </b></h2>
                    Mainstream success (2009-2012) After a string of films in which she was cast in glamorous, "arm candy" roles, Kaif began looking for more substantial parts.One such opportunity arose with Kabir Khan's terrorism drama New York (2009). Costarring John Abraham
                    and Neil Nitin Mukesh, the film follows the lives of three friends when one of them is wrongly detained after 9/11. Kaif played Maya, a college student who unknowingly marries a terrorist. Having faced racial discrimination when she
                    was in London, Kaif identified with the character's experiences.New York performed well at the box office and received favourable reviews. According to Subhash K. Jha, Kaif was successful as an actress in a substantial role and convincingly
                    portrayed her character's transition from a carefree student to a tormented wife.A reviewer for The Times of India considered it to be her career's best performance. New York brought Kaif her first Filmfare Award nomination for Best
                    Actress.She then appeared in a cameo for India's first underwater thriller Blue. Kaif starred with Ranbir Kapoor in Rajkumar Santoshi's hit comedy, Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), as an orphan forced to marry a rich man.[81] Taran
                    Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised the actors' energetic pairing and found that Kaif performed well in both emotional and light scenes. Her final film of the year was Priyadarshan's comedy De Dana Dan. Ajay Devgan, Arjun Rampal, Nana
                    Patekar, Manoj Bajpai and Sarah Thompson. The film took inspiration from The Mahabharata and Mario Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather. Set in Bhopal, the film described a fiercely fought election campaign by two parties attempting to
                    seize power with manipulation, corruption, and treachery. Kaif rejected the media's speculation that her character was based on Sonia Gandhi. In preparation for her role as Indu, a politician loosely based on Draupadi, she watched
                    Priyanka Gandhi's election campaign videos to study the body language and interaction of politicians.The film received mainly positive reviews from critics. Rajeev Masand found Raajneeti "thrilling and gripping", though Namrata Joshi
                    was critical of the film's depiction of women.Nikhat Kazmi considered Kaif's performance to be "carefree and camera-unconscious" and wrote that she "seems to slip into the high-powered shoes easily".[90] The film was highly successful
                    at the box office, receiving a total collection of ₹1.4 billion (US$18 million).Kaif collaborated with Akshay Kumar for the sixth time in the slapstick comedy Tees Maar Khan (2010), in which she played an aspiring actress, the girlfriend
                    of a criminal (Kumar). In the film, Kaif performed a popular item number titled "Sheila Ki Jawani". The song was choreographed by the film's director Farah Khan and for the belly dancing portion, Kaif was trained by expert Veronica
                    D'Souza. In contrast to the song's popularity, Tees Maar Khan was panned by critics and its box-office performance was poor. Kaif's portrayal was not well received; Renuka Rao of Daily News and Analysis found her "drama queen act"
                    poor but noted that she was exceptional in the item number. The following year, Kaif was paired with Hrithik Roshan in Zoya Akhtar's coming-of-age dramedy Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. The film narrates the story of three friends on a
                    bachelor trip and features Kaif as Laila, a diving instructor who becomes romantically involved with Roshan's character and inspires him overcome his workaholism. She had difficulty filming her scuba diving scene due to her inexperience;
                    she was so scared she dug her nails into costar Roshan.The film was a critical and commercial success. Richard Kuipers of Variety commented that she is "delightful" in the role of a cordial young woman who encourages others to confront
                    their weaknesses. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara received numerous Best Film accolades. The romantic comedy Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2011), produced by Yash Raj Films, starred Kaif alongside Imran Khan and Ali Zafar. She found herself challenged
                    by the role of Dimple Dixit, whose loquacious and unpredictable nature strongly contrasted with Kaif's personality.[104] The film opened to mixed reviews, but Kaif was generally praised for her portrayal.[46][105] The book Mother Maiden
                    Mistress calls Dimple one of the more interesting female characters of the year.[106] According to Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times, the film is mainly watchable for "Katrina's live-wire energy wherein she never goes overboard and
                    keeps bustling with vivacity through the runtime." For this performance, Kaif received her second Filmfare memory of Chopra.
